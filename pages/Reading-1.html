	<p>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word “user”?</p>

		<p1>Lialina writes about the use of the word ‘user’ and the different meaning that word has been used to describe in the tech world. she argues that changing the word ‘user’ to ‘people’,applies a more human aspect for the developers. however the word ‘user’ still fits; to quote “Bloggers, artists, podcasters and even trolls are still users of systems they didn’t program. So they (we) are all the users.” the person operates the technology given to them. this meaning that the developers don’t follow under the term user but developed for the user. Lialina talks about how the first developers imagined the ideal user for the technology but user was a is at the mercy of what the technology allows them to accomplish; its kind of like saying who came first, the chicken or the egg, but in this case who came first the programmers / developers or the (imaginary) user. Which is the product of which?</p1>

	<p>What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</p>

		<p1>general purpose user can create / produce what they want even without the knowledge of how they got there, or why they only have certain options. They are limited and at the hands of the programers and developers.
		ideal user can take what’s been made and make it their own to serve whatever purpose they so desire. no limitations.  taking the devices or apps as is and using their own knowledge. 
		Providing yourself and others freedom from the set code of different web and social medias layouts, advertisements, etc.</p1>

	<p>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users”?</p>
		<p1>When uploading to YouTube.
 			1) immediately upload file, you have to open your files, search for the correct folders and make a selection.
			2) the computer loads the file to make it accessible. It tries to set the name for the official upload based off the file selected. however that is often not always right. in which case the user goes in and sets the name.
			3) the user then creates a description and tags that they so wish in the designated boxes.
			4)then if the user wishes they can go into advance settings and alter the “automatic” settings that youtube creates. such as: category, video language, video statistics, licenses, etc. 
			5) youtube then recommends thumbnails for you to use that are stills from the content of the video you uploaded HOWEVER you are able to go into photoshop and or any other jpeg supporting software and create your own. 
			6)click done and its up.</p1>
